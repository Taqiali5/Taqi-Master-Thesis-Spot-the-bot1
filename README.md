This project implements an unsupervised pipeline to detect AI-generated (bot) text using semantic trajectory clustering. Focused on Lao and Luxembourgish—two low-resource languages—the approach combines trigram embeddings (FastText, Word2Vec), dimensionality reduction, and Wishart clustering to distinguish between human and GPT-generated text.
